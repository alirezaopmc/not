# Numerical Optimization Course

A comprehensive Python-based course on numerical optimization based on "Numerical Optimization" by Nocedal & Wright and "Algorithms for Optimization" by Kochenderfer & Wheeler.

## ðŸ“š Course Structure

### Chapters (Jupyter Notebooks)
- **Chapter 1**: Introduction to Numerical Optimization âœ…
  - What is Optimization?
  - The Gradient and its Role
  - Taylor Expansions (1st and 2nd order)
  - Computational Challenges
  - Calculus Review
  - Interactive Examples

### Supporting Code
- **`utils/`**: Supporting Python modules
  - `visualization.py`: Plotting functions for optimization
  - `functions.py`: Mathematical test functions and derivatives
- **`examples/`**: Additional examples and exercises

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Start Jupyter
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### 3. Open Chapter 1
Navigate to `chapters/chapter_01_introduction.ipynb`

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
